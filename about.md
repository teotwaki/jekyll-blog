Hi, I'm Sebastian. I am teotwaki on [GitHub][github-teotwaki] and on
[Twitter][twitter-teotwaki]. You can also reach me via [email][email].

I'm a freelance consultant in the Copenhagen area (more about that
[here][unticks]), previously VP of Engineering at Dixa, and Engineering Lead at
Realm. I currently live in Copenhagen, Denmark, but have previously lived in
France, Belgium, UK, Australia, US, and a few other places.

I mostly work in Rust, Python and Bash, virtually exclusively on GNU/Linux.
However, I do not consider myself a "x developer". I believe---as much as I
love some of them---that programming languages are nothing more than tools, and
like any tool, they are not necessarily all best-suited for any task.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll], and is styled by the fantastic
[Mediator theme][mediator-theme] created by [Dirk Fabisch][dirk-blog]. The
source code for this blog is available on [GitHub][github-jekyll-blog].
