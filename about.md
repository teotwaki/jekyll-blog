Hi, I'm Sebastian. I am teotwaki on [GitHub][github-teotwaki] and on
[Twitter][twitter-teotwaki]. You can also reach me via [email][email].

I'm a software engineer at Realm where I primarily work on the core database
engine. I'm currently in the process of relocating to Denmark, and should be
there permanently in early September.

I am a firm believer in Free Software, and humbly attempt to further that cause
whenever I can. On that side, I have not been as productive as I would've liked
over the past few years. I hope to fix that in the coming months.

I mostly work in C++, Python and Bash, virtually exclusively on GNU/Linux.
However, I do not consider myself a "C++ developer" or "Python programmer." I
believe---as much as I love some of them---that programming languages are
nothing more than tools, and like any tool, they are not necessarily
best-suited for all tasks.
