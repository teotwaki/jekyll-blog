Over the last few days, I've been working on a technical problem that I'll be
documenting on this very blog in the coming days. In the meantime, I just
wanted to post a quick note to say that this blog (along with a bunch of other
services that I host) is now SSL-enabled.

I decided to deploy proper SSL, because I honestly believe that most pages
these days should be encrypted, even if the content isn't necessarily
security-worthy.  I don't believe that what I'm writing here is offensive or
could put any of my readers in harms way. However, I do believe that everyone
should be able to browse whatever they want without having to fear any
government, ISP or other malicious organisation trying to steal knowledge about
them.

So, here's a shout-out to [StartSSL][startssl], a great company that offers
free SSL certificates (AFAICT, for personal use only), and hopes that enough
Heartbleed-like exploits show up so they can make a profit.

Also, thanks to [Eric Mill][ericmill] for making StartSSL's less-than-obvious
user experience more manageable.
