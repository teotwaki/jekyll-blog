Please note: This article was initially published on my previous blog, called
*Arrogant and Condescending*, on 2nd February 2011.

*Today Broderick told me he was going to reply to one of my blog posts. Now, I
haven't written in quite some time (six months now), and scanning over the last
few posts, I have to say I wasn't too proud. My post about the veil has crossed
a few people, and Yvan and Broderick have made very good points. I'd like to
stress out that most of the article was __written__ in a tongue-in-cheek fashion
– I realise this doesn't mean that's how it __reads__.*

*Regardless, I'd like to discuss something completely different, rather than
righting my wrongs (I'd much prefer an active discussion rather than just adding
verses to an incomplete rhetoric), so after much a due, here we go.*

A couple of months ago, Mohamad, one very active community member in Maemo was
lamenting about the closed-source components of the operating system. The media
player, the conversations, the application manager: these are all bits and
pieces that lock the user away from freedom. And  that is, obviously, a bad thing.

As the conversation flowed, we pitched the idea of reimplementing the media player
completely; writing it from scratch, copying the user interface (as to not
alienate users). Apart from a few very serious flaws in Nokia's current
implementation, we wouldn't actually try to improve change too much, and then let
the community decide what is best for the media player. Basically, we wanted to 
gift the media player's source code to the Community – an act of faith that Nokia
has never deigned to grant its customers.

A few weeks later, and we're starting to get somewhere. Mohamad has done amazing
work on the graphical user interface, various contributors have donated time and
brain matter in order to give us a rudimentary clone. I was very pleased. Then,
it was decided to "announce" this development effort properly to the community.

People deciding to work, and actually doing it, and for a good cause, nothing
could be wrong, right? _Wrong_. We got __slammed__. People started flaming about the
feasability, about the usability, about the needability; all in a very
unobfuscated demeanour of stupidity.

The loudest people were well known Community Trolls: people who seemingly enjoy
annoying others and engaging in relatively counter-productive behaviour. At the
same time, the Community SSU (allowing the Community to manage the software
updates, rather than relying on Nokia, which has abandoned the platform) was
announced by very much the same group of people as those responsible for the
Media Player reimplementation; by and large the same trollish and
counter-productive responses were given to this project as well.

I didn't understand this. Why, again and again, would people start yelling and
screaming as soon as something was done. I first naively attributed it to the
fact people don't like change, but then I noticed, somehow, the same behaviour
at work. Luckily _not_ "the same" – we don't have people behaving like hooligans
as soon as one offers food for thought – however both reactions couldn't be 
entirely happening at random.

There are two discussions at my company, in particular, that have "leaked" in
that sense. One was about Source Control Management, a purely technical
discussion that, yes, – hypothetically, could have – affected a few people,
the other about the technical architecture of a system-wide method of 
communication. Both discussions stalled in quite a dramatic manner, mostly 
because everyone wanted to see their own ideology put forward.

In full disclosure, I pitched the SCM-discussion, and having rather not adapted
to the French's inability to understand candour ('t was my first week, after
all), may be partly to blame for how badly it degenerated.

This being said, the other discussion, about some architectural decision, I
believe is an excellent example of misdirected management: instead of asking
people how they can contribute (read: help make the current solution better),
you ask them if they see an issue. The immediate response, usually, is "Yes,
however we don't have it if we do it _my way_". Don't ask them to offer a solution,
insist that they __improve the current one__.

I then started searching, online, as I would research a technical problem. At
some point, someone on Twitter pointed me towards a seemingly random, if well
named, [website][1]. I'll quote a bit of it (though, reading the whole page is
definitely worth it):

Whoa. Poul-Henning Kamp, where the hell have you been all this time? There really
isn't much more to say; PHK's text is so painfully insightful and well written
that I don't have any words.

We all have our bike sheds to build. But frankly, I'd rather not build them over
the weekend. So when you hit reply, think very, _very_ carefully about what you are
going to type next. Be extremely thorough, and _assume good faith_. Put your ego
aside, and let the person who launched an initiative drive it. You may be piqued
that you didn't do it, that they implemented an idea before you had the time; the
truth is you should embrace this.

Regardless of the context in which you interpret these words (an Open Source
project, your job), please remember that in most cases everyone is sharing the
same goal; everyone is trying to _further things_, and __improve things__.

It is not because you think you have the intellectual, or technological, or
managerial _right_ to comment on something that you should.
