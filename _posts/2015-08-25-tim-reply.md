An old Maemo friend [reached out on Twitter][twitter] and asked for help regarding some
issue he was running into using mysqli and PHP. Below is my response that I

Hi Tim,

Looks like you've had a few issues here :). As a general rule, I like to go
back to pure-MySQL, and remove as much application logic as possible. In this
case, as you've already discovered, it's possible to do it all in MySQL.

But first, let's do part of what you forgot to do (and which is probably why
you got downvoted a bit): let's create a test MySQL table so we can run some
queries on it:

```
mysql> create table uploads (
    ->   af_uid int unsigned,
    ->   af_fid int unsigned,
    ->   af_dfilename varchar(100),
    ->   af_upload_date datetime
    -> );

mysql> insert into uploads values
    -> (101, 10, 'cat.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:42:46'),
    -> (101, 10, 'dog.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:43:01'),
    -> (101, 11, 'doc.pdf', '2015-08-16 14:44:23'),
    -> (101, 10, 'foo.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:45:00'),
    -> (101, 10, 'bar.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:45:36'),
    -> (101, 10, 'php.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:46:10'),
    -> (101, 10, 'mysql.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:46:52'),
    -> (102, 10, 'fubar.jpg', '2015-08-16 14:51:03');
```

From your question, there's 4 parts to the query you're trying to write:

- you only want `uid = 101`;
- you only want `fid = 10`;
- you want the 5 last items uploaded;
- you only want the 5 first results.

```
mysql> select *
    -> from uploads
    -> where af_uid = 101
    -> and af_fid = 10
    -> order by af_upload_date desc
    -> limit 5;
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
| af_uid | af_fid | af_dfilename | af_upload_date      |
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
|    101 |     10 | mysql.jpg    | 2015-08-16 14:46:52 |
|    101 |     10 | php.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:46:10 |
|    101 |     10 | bar.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:45:36 |
|    101 |     10 | foo.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:45:00 |
|    101 |     10 | dog.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:43:01 |
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

I'm not seeing `limit` misbehaving here, as long as the rest of the query does
what it's supposed to do. A couple notes to keep in mind for the future,
though:

Please don't put integer values in quotes. In SQL (and most other languages),
there's no reason to do so. You're just asking the system to do more casting
and whatnot. Secondly, try to do most work in MySQL, especially when it comes
to filtering. Always try to reduce your dataset as much as possible in the
first step. There are certain situations where it can be useful to do some
filtering on the client side, but those are micro-optimisations that really
only come in very later.

Anyway, now, let's dig in to the rest of your question and more specifically,
let's try to figure out what was going wrong. If we run your original query
directly in MySQL, we'll notice that we get interesting results:

```
mysql> select *
    -> from uploads
    -> where af_uid = 101
    -> order by af_upload_date desc
    -> limit 5;
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
| af_uid | af_fid | af_dfilename | af_upload_date      |
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
|    101 |     10 | mysql.jpg    | 2015-08-16 14:46:52 |
|    101 |     10 | php.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:46:10 |
|    101 |     10 | bar.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:45:36 |
|    101 |     10 | foo.jpg      | 2015-08-16 14:45:00 |
|    101 |     11 | doc.pdf      | 2015-08-16 14:44:23 |
+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Notice that because of the order in which things appear in the table (due to
the `order by` clause), the last item actually has `af_fid = 11`.

Now, if on the client side, we apply extra filtering as you're doing with `if
($row['af_fid']) == 10)`, it would only make sense that we end up with only 4
results.

I'm not sure why you saw 3 results, but I'm going to warrant a guess and say
that it was due to some differences in the code or data, compared to what you
posted on SO. Conclusion: if you'd done all your filtering in SQL from the get
go, you most probably would've never hit this roadblock to start with.

Feel free to ping me if you have other questions.
